REVIEW CHECKLIST -- every migration on this project is read by a human before it runs:
  * No DROP of a table or column carrying financial state without explicit human approval.
  * Monetary columns are integer minor units (DECISION S4-1): `amount_minor BIGINT` plus
    `currency`, `scale` and `currency_def_version`. Never NUMERIC/DECIMAL as authoritative
    money, never float.
  * Constraints carry deterministic names from the `app.db.base` naming convention.
  * `downgrade()` is honest: if a step cannot be reversed without losing financial
    history, it raises rather than pretending.
